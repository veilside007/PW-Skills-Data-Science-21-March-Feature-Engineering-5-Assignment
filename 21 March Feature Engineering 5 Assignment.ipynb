    "Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you\n",

    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding are both techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical format. However, they differ in their application and suitability for different types of categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ordinal Encoding**:\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding is used when the categorical variable has an inherent order or ranking.\n",
    "- It assigns numerical labels to categories based on their order or rank.\n",
    "- The numerical labels are typically integers ranging from 1 to the number of categories.\n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding preserves the ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Label Encoding**:\n",
    "- Label Encoding is a more general technique used for categorical variables without any inherent order.\n",
    "- It assigns numerical labels to categories in an arbitrary manner, usually starting from 0 or 1.\n",
    "- The numerical labels are not based on any specific order or rank among the categories.\n",
    "- Label Encoding does not preserve any ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset containing a \"Temperature\" variable with categories \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High.\" Let's consider two scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scenario 1: Temperature has an Ordinal Relationship**:\n",
    "   - In this scenario, we know that \"Low\" < \"Medium\" < \"High\" in terms of temperature.\n",
    "   - Ordinal Encoding would be appropriate because it preserves this ordinal relationship.\n",
    "   - Example: Ordinal Encoding might assign labels as follows: \"Low\" = 1, \"Medium\" = 2, \"High\" = 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scenario 2: Temperature has No Inherent Order**:\n",
    "   - In this scenario, \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High\" are just arbitrary labels without any inherent order.\n",
    "   - Label Encoding would be more suitable as it doesn't impose any order among the categories.\n",
    "   - Example: Label Encoding might assign labels as follows: \"Low\" = 0, \"Medium\" = 1, \"High\" = 2."

    "Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in\n",
    "a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the target variable in a supervised machine learning problem. It assigns ordinal ranks to categories of a categorical variable based on the mean or median of the target variable for each category. This encoding aims to capture the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable, making it especially useful for binary classification or regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Calculate the Mean or Median of the Target Variable for Each Category**:\n",
    "   - For each category of the categorical variable, calculate the mean or median of the target variable. This provides a measure of the average target value associated with each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rank the Categories Based on Mean or Median of the Target Variable**:\n",
    "   - Rank the categories based on the calculated mean or median values of the target variable. The category with the lowest mean or median value gets assigned the lowest rank, while the category with the highest mean or median value gets assigned the highest rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Replace Categories with Their Respective Ranks**:\n",
    "   - Replace the original categories of the categorical variable with their respective ranks obtained in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ordinal Encoding**:\n",
    "   - Finally, perform ordinal encoding on the ranked categories to convert them into numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Usage**:\n",
    "Consider a dataset for predicting customer default on a loan, where one of the categorical variables is \"Education Level\" with categories such as \"High School,\" \"College,\" and \"Graduate.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenario**: You want to predict the likelihood of default on a loan based on the customer's education level.\n",
    "- **Usage of Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**:\n",
    "   - You can use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to rank the education levels based on their average default rates.\n",
    "   - For each education level category, calculate the mean default rate (percentage of customers defaulting on loans) associated with that category.\n",
    "   - Rank the education levels based on their mean default rates, with the category having the lowest default rate assigned the lowest rank and so on.\n",
    "   - Replace the original education level categories with their respective ranks obtained from the previous step.\n",
    "   - Perform ordinal encoding on the ranked education levels to convert them into numerical values.\n",
    "   - Now, the education level variable is encoded based on its relationship with the target variable (default rate), which can potentially improve the predictive power of the model."

    "Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is a measure of the relationship between two random variables. It indicates the degree to which two variables change together. Specifically, covariance measures how much two variables vary together, i.e., if one variable increases, does the other tend to increase as well, or does it decrease?\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical analysis, covariance is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Relationship between Variables**: Covariance helps understand the direction of the relationship between two variables. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates that they move in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Strength of Relationship**: The magnitude of covariance provides information about the strength of the relationship between variables. Larger covariance values indicate a stronger relationship, while smaller values suggest a weaker relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Comparison of Relationships**: Covariance allows for the comparison of relationships between different pairs of variables. By comparing covariance values, one can determine which pairs of variables are more strongly related.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Linear Dependence**: Covariance is particularly useful in understanding linear relationships between variables. In linear regression analysis, for example, covariance plays a crucial role in determining the coefficients of the regression equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance between two random variables X and Y is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\cdot (y_i - \\bar{y}) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the number of observations.\n",
    "- \\( x_i \\) and \\( y_i \\) are the individual observations of variables X and Y, respectively.\n",
    "- \\( \\bar{x} \\) and \\( \\bar{y} \\) are the means of variables X and Y, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, in terms of sample covariance, the formula can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x}) \\cdot (y_i - \\bar{y}) \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "This adjusted formula corrects for bias in the estimation of population covariance using a sample. The sample covariance formula divides by \\( n-1 \\) instead of \\( n \\) to provide an unbiased estimate of the population covariance."

    "\n",
    "1. **Gender**:\n",
    "   - Since \"Gender\" is a binary categorical variable with only two categories (Male/Female), we can use binary encoding or label encoding.\n",
